# CombatRedone-Maps
Here, the mapmakers for the Minecraft server CombatRedone will share the map files for their in-game minigame maps for review and submission.

To upload a map:

Make sure the map is in a proper Minecraft world folder.
Create a pull of this project and upload the file to that.
Send the pull request back to this repository for review.
I will review the files, and then add them to the server if I approve of them.
